# Game Story : 
The nuclear apocalypse is upon us. Most of the life on earth is wiped out. You are a lone survivor for as far as you have seen, at least you’ve yet to encounter another fellow human. As time progresses, the atmosphere has become too toxic to continue living in. You have no choice but to move to the underground to continue your existence. However, you need to dig up a space underground first! Using your knowledge of robotics, you build a line of drones to do your bidding. Be sure to touch up on your programming skills, however, because these drones are as clueless as a fried pickle! It’s up to you to program the drone’s AI, so make sure to read up on the Lua programming language, the drone’s preferred language.

You wish to be able to accomodate any survivors who may happen to wander past, so you have a lot of work to do!

# Description

Coding for kids and adults can be a daunting task to learn, like learning an entirely new language. For people who do not know coding, building an app would be a daunting task. This is why we are creating Diggums. Diggums provides a very simple format for budding programmers to learn and master the basic concepts in programming.

Diggums is a game that requires the player to code using a real programming language (Lua) to solve a variety of tasks. The game will be set underground where players will be guiding drones to dig tunnels. Players must write and run the code to control the drone for it to accomplish its tasks. By playing this game, the players will instantly see the results of their efforts and hopefully will encourage them to pursue further programming endeavours.

As the game progresses, the game becomes more complex. The game will start with basic functions (such as move forward, turn left, turn right) that players can use. There will be roadblocks and problems that will challenge players to think of a solution. They can then make their function and algorithms to solve these problems. As soon as the players get comfortable with the game and learn the basics in programming, the focus of the game is not only to solve the problem and make the code work but also to work well because the game scores the players on how efficient their code is.

There will be a support system and guides in this game that will help confused players. This game is suitable for anyone interested in diving into the world of programming whether it’s just a hobby or career. (*modified)
